# Assignments

There are three assignments, worth a total of 12 points, plus a bonus assignment assessed near the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to get you to think about design, and to help familiarize you with UI programming basics.

<!-- Assignments are to be completed individually. You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing or to share code. -->

## A0: Slack introduction

In this assignment, your task is to join the CPSC481 Slack chat http://cpsc481-2018s.slack.com/, and introduce yourself.
- Create a Slack account
- Join http://cpsc481-2018s.slack.com/
- Put a **picture of yourself** in your account
- Post a message in the #profiles channel with your name, why you are taking this course, something that interests you, and your desired super power (or a super power you have).


## A1: Heuristic evaluation report and presentation

In this assignement, your task is to choose a computational system and carry out Heuristic Evaluation as seen during the lecture.
- Choose a system
- Carry out the evaluation
- Write a report
- Present your findings


## A2: User-centered research

You are to consider the IDEO methods for one design problem that you have, identifying which would be good methods for understanding the design problem, and arguing for why. **This is an individual assignment.**

Choose one design problem. From here, identify one method from each of the four IDEO categories (look, listen, try, and learn) that you could conduct to develop an understanding of the design problem and the users in it. Thus, choose a total of four methods -- one from each of the IDEO categories. The four methods you choose should complement one another.

From here, you need to do three things:
1. Explain how you would apply each IDEO method (one from each of the categories) with sufficient detail that your manager would be able to do it without you.
2. Justify why the method is a good one in this context.
3. Explain how the methods complement one another (i.e. fill in gaps knowledge that other methods leave open).

Your report should be roughly 3/4 to 1 physical page long. Use headers to delineate the different sections of the report.

Use 12-pt Times font with 1" margin on all sides.



## A3: UI Patterns for your project

In this assignment, your task is to present at least 5 UI patterns to be used in your project.
Each member of the team must present at least one pattern.
The team should present these patterns on June 13. (10min presentation)


## Bonus: Weekly submissions to #designexamples
Learning how to design effectively is really about thinking about design regularly. For bonus marks (up to 2%, at discretion of course instructor), post regularly to the Slack channels #baddesign and #gooddesign (e.g. twice a week for each week in the term). An effective post includes:
- a photo of an object/interface that is an example of good (or bad) design,
- an explanation for why it is good (or bad),
- and if it is a bad design, a design alternative that solves the problem.
